                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                    <br>
       
                    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p><br>
                    <code></code>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

                <div class="declaring-variables-text">
                    <p>
                        You can declare a variable in three ways:
                        With the keyword var. For example,
                    </p>
                    <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
    
                        By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                    </p>
                    <div class="all-code"><code>var x = 42.</code></div>
                </div>
                
            </section>
     
     
            <section class="main-section" id="global_variables">
                    <header>Global Variables </header>
                    <div class="global-variables-text">
                        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
                        <code></code>
                    </div>
            </section>
     
     
            <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
                <header>Data Types</header>
                <div class="data-types-text">
                <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <!-- <code></code> -->
                <ul>
                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li> 
                </ul>
                </div>
            </section>
     
     
            <section class="main-section" id="function_declaration">
                <header>Function Declaration</header>
                <div class="function-declaration-text">
                    <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                    <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
    
                    <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                    <div class="all-code">
                        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">

                        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
